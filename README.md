# Titanic-project
This is a project of introduction to machine learning based on a famous dataset-Titanic dataset. In this project, I'm going to start from basic idea, like data processing, dealing with missing values, convert data type, to some advanced aspects, like fitting dataset to different models, doing validation, visualizing data and etc.
